You'll need to order custom circuitboards from a manufacturer such as [JLCPCB](http://jlcpcb.com), [PcbWay](https://www.pcbway.com), [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com). Don't worry, this is easy and cheap!

Feel free to pick any manufacturer that is cheap and convenient. We have good experience with JLCPCB. You can also compare offers from different manufacturers on [pcbshopper.com](http://pcbshopper.com).

Start by downloading [gerber files](https://github.com/iley/kamaji/raw/master/pcb/button_v1/gerbers.zip) from github.

Upload the archive with gerber files to your PCB manufacturer of choice. Generally, the default options that most manufacturers offer should work fine. Use the standard 1.6mm FR4 PCB material.

Here's what the order page might look like:

Order and wait!
