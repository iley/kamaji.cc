Here you'll find an instruction for building a "Classic" Kamaji system.

The Classic is a standalone system with an LCD and control buttons. Unlike the [Headless](/hardware/headless), it does not require connecting to a PC/Tablet.

Key features:

 * Max. 5 player buttons
 * USB-A socket for connecting a signal lamp
 * Built-in buzzer


To use a Kamaji Classic you will additionally need:

 * 2-5 [Kamaji buttons](/hardware/buttons)
 * USB power supply or powerbank (see [Known bugs](#known_bugs) below)
 * USB-B cable


Note that Kamaji Classic uses a USB-B socket (not to be confused with Mini-B and Micro-B) for power which are uncommon nowadays.

### Known bugs:

 * Some powerbanks cannot reliably power Kamaji Classic. The system power consumption is so low that some powerbanks don't recognize it as a connected device and shut off the power after a few minutes.
