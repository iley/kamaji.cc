Here are the tools you'll need for building the Kamaji hardware:

 * Soldering iron. Just about any soldering iron would do, but having adjustable temperature is handy. TS-100/TS-101 and Pinecil are the go-to recommendations.
 * 3D-printer. Alternatively you can order 3D-printed parts from an on-demand printing service.
 * Side-cutters for cutting off leads of resistors and other components.
 * Philips screwdriver.
 * Tweezers.
 * (optional) [soldering tips for threaded inserts](https://cnckitchen.store/products/einschmelzhilfen-soldering-tips-m2-m2-5-m3-m4-m5-m6-1-4-m8-100-lead-and-cadmium-free). These are convenient, but you can also use a regular conical soldering tip for the treaded inserts.

You will also need some consumables:

 * Solder. We typically use the classic 60/40 leaded solder in 0.5mm thickness with flux core. If you want a lead-free alternative, ISO-Core "Clear" works fine.
 * Flux. Even when you use solder with a flux core, additional flux will be needed at times.
 * Isopropyl alcohol or some other cleaning agent for getting the flux residue off the PCBs after soldering.
 * 3D-printer filament. We typically use PETG, but PLA also works.
