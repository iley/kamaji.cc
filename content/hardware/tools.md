Here are the tools you'll need for building the Kamaji hardware:

 * Soldering iron. Just about any soldering iron would do, but having adjustable temperature is handy. TS-100/TS-101 and Pinecil are the go-to recommendations.
 * Side-cutters for cutting off leads of resistors and other components.
 * Philips screwdriver.
 * 3D-printer. Alternatively you can order 3D-printed parts from an on-demand printing service.
