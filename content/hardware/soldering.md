If you never soldered before, please check out an online tutorial or ask somebody to teach you. It's not a hard skill to learn!

Some general tips:

 * Use more flux!
 * Don't skip on cleaning the circuitboard after solering. The flux might be corrosive and/or conductive. Isopropyl alcohol would do the trick.

Here's a quick guide by Mitch Altman and Andie Nordgren (taken from [PEN wiki](http://eburn.scripts.mit.edu/pened/doku.php/background/how.to.guides/soldering)):
