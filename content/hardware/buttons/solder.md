Solder the parts to the PCB in the following order:

 1. Cherry MX switch.
 2. The LED. There should be an indent on the keyswitch for it.
 3. RJ10 socket.

Tips:

 * All parts go onto the same side of the PCB, the one that has component names and outlines.
 * Double-check that the switch is aligned with the outline printed on the PCB.
 * Make sure to solder the LED the right way around. The long lead is the anode (+). There's a handy drawing printed on the PCB.

Also see the [general information on soldering](/hardware/soldering).

The end result should look like this:

Next up you'll need to [print an enclosure](/hardware/buttons/3d-print-enclosure/).
